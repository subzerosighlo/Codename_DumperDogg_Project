- Project Overview -
This project was built with the idea of the small time garbage company that can't afford the "big dog" software or pay for a developer to write thier own software. I decided to make this project open source so everyone could add to the project.

The market for open source trash hauling software isn't really a thing. Not much is out there so if i can start a project that will help the little guys in a big guys world then i am all about it.





Things That Need To Be Done -
1). Need a Login/Reister System 2). Need to implement Admin section 3). Let the user print off a pdf version of their dump slip for record keeping purposes 4). Let the user delete their account and all data assotacated with their account







Project Completion Date -
