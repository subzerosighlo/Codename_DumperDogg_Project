Improved project name: DumpRover

As of 4/22/2023, DumpRover now allows users to register and login to their account, and view a dashboard displaying a list of previously submitted dump tickets. Users can create, update, and delete tickets, and the system automatically calculates and saves the weight in tons of each ticket submitted.

Upcoming features include an admin dashboard and customizable options. Additionally, a Docker image will be created to facilitate easy setup for small companies.

The DumpRover project was created with the aim of providing small garbage companies with affordable software. This open-source project aims to fill a gap in the market for trash hauling software, making it accessible to those who can't afford expensive solutions or dedicated developers.

The expected completion date for the project is within the next year, depending on further development needs.
