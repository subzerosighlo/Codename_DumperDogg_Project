4/22/2023 Update - Did some major improvements in a one nighter session. So far this is the funtionatity it has:

Users can login and register for an account
once logged in or registered it will take you to your dashboard screen where you will see a list of already submitted dump tickets and a button to create dump tickets
can create tickets and update tickets
also can delete tickets
the system will also auto input the tons, when the ticket is created it will calcuate what the tons is for the ticket and then save it to the database

Plan on adding these features soon:

Admin dashboard
Customize options
get it to a easy self intstall wizard
setup docker image for easy spin up for the small time compaines

                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                          
- Project Overview -


This project was built with the idea of the small time garbage company that can't afford the "big dog" software or pay for a developer to write thier own software. I decided to make this project open source so everyone could add to the project.

The market for open source trash hauling software isn't really a thing. Not much is out there so if i can start a project that will help the little guys in a big guys world then i am all about it.

1 year - Depending..
